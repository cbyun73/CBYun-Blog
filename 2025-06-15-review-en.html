<p>✅ Introduction<br />
As I entered my 50s and started preparing for the second chapter of my life, I realized that AI is no longer optional—it's essential.<br />
While watching various YouTube videos introducing AI, one figure stood out: <strong>CareerHacker Alex</strong>.<br />
His approach to ChatGPT and AI was unlike any superficial overview I’d seen before. I thought, “I really want to learn this properly.”<br />
Fortunately, I found out that Alex himself was offering a <strong>practical ChatGPT course</strong> supported by the Korean government.<br />
Being able to take such a high-quality course at an incredibly low cost through the national “Naeil Learning Card” program was truly lucky.<br />
So I didn’t hesitate to enroll—and now I’m confident it was the right decision.</p>

  I needed structured AI learning to prepare for my second career, and I didn’t want to miss the chance to take a hands-on course by CareerHacker Alex at a low cost through government funding.</p>

<p>🛠️ What I Did During the Course</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Understanding and Relearning ChatGPT</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>In the first week, I studied how ChatGPT works and realized I had only scratched the surface.  </li>
<li>I experienced how <strong>"good questions yield better answers"</strong>, and I began using ChatGPT not just as a chatbot, but as a productivity and thinking tool.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Prompt Engineering for Image Analysis (Week 2)</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>I learned how to guide ChatGPT’s responses intentionally.  </li>
<li>This helped me significantly enhance an ongoing AI-based image analysis project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Automation Tools Integration (Week 3)</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>I practiced integrating ChatGPT with the Gamma app to automatically generate presentations and documents.  </li>
<li>I saw the potential for real-world use by auto-summarizing analysis results into structured formats.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Advanced GPTs + GitHub Integration (Week 4)</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Although the course was scheduled through July 2, I completed all core lessons by early week 4.  </li>
<li>I’ve since focused on advanced GPT functions and building automation tools with GitHub to prepare for AI-based content creation and blog automation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>After the Course – My Own Use Cases</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Even after the official end date of June 15, I’ll continue learning until July 2, focusing on report automation, image analysis, and AI-powered writing.  </li>
<li>I plan to apply ChatGPT in preparing for the national judicial scrivener exam and pursuing my dream of becoming a writer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>📝 Final Thoughts<br />
Being able to take such a hands-on AI course through government support was a huge stroke of luck.<br />
This wasn’t just about using ChatGPT as a tool—it was about building a foundation for generating content and automation in my own workflow.<br />
I plan to apply this experience to blogging, automation, and image-based projects going forward.<br />
Below are 3 sample images representing some of the work I’ve done using ChatGPT during the course.</p>
