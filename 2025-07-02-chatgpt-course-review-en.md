## Getting Started

As I prepare for the second chapter of my life, Iâ€™ve come to realize that understanding AI is no longer optionalâ€”it's essential.  
While browsing YouTube, I came across an AI educator named **CareerHacker Alex**, whose approach to ChatGPT and productivity tools stood out immediately.  
To my surprise, I discovered that **he was offering a full ChatGPT course through a government-sponsored program** here in South Korea, and I enrolled without hesitation.

## What I Actually Did

1. **Week 1 â€“ Understanding ChatGPT and Rebuilding Basics**  
   I reviewed the principles and history of ChatGPT, and realized how inefficiently I had been using it.  
   Once I understood its internal logic, my conversations with the model became far more productive.

2. **Week 2 â€“ Prompt Engineering & Image Analysis**  
   Focused on structuring prompts effectively. I applied this to my ongoing image analysis project and saw a clear improvement in precision.

3. **Week 3 â€“ Automating Workflows with Gamma**  
   Learned how to link ChatGPT with tools like Gamma to auto-generate reports and presentation slides from AI output.

4. **Week 4 â€“ Advanced GPTs + GitHub Integration**  
   Combined manual verification with AI-driven automation. This laid the groundwork for building my GitHub blog and content automation systems.

5. **Remaining Weeks â€“ Selective Deep Dive**  
   I plan to focus on areas like report automation and content structuringâ€”fields I need for my upcoming writing and exam preparation projects.

## What I Learned

- **Understanding before using**: Just asking questions isnâ€™t enoughâ€”how you frame them makes all the difference.  
- **Prompt design is critical**, but the course covers so many real-world use cases that it can feel overwhelming.  
- Fortunately, the course allows you to choose your focus areas even after it ends.

Also, I really appreciated the fact that **I could take Alexâ€™s course almost free of charge thanks to the government support (via a National Training Program).** It felt like a rare opportunity.

## How Iâ€™ll Use It Going Forward

- **Blog Series on GitHub**  
  Iâ€™m planning to write about real AI applications like image analysis, and even AI-assisted historical mapping of places like the Seoul Fortress Trail.

- **Markdown-based Multilingual Blog**  
  Iâ€™ll build a bilingual (Koreanâ€“English) blog using GitHub Pages with toggles and markdown formatting.

- **Studying + Writing with AI**  
  Iâ€™m also preparing for a national exam, and ChatGPT will be an essential part of how I structure and automate my study materials.  
  Long-term, I hope to integrate AI into writing and consulting work.
