<h1>üó≥Ô∏è 2025 South Korean Presidential Election: A Simple Yet Accurate Prediction Model</h1>

<p>‚úÖ <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
On June 3, 2025, South Korea held an unprecedented presidential election following the impeachment of the former president under martial law. Despite political turbulence and rapidly shifting polls, I found that a remarkably simple formula allowed for a surprisingly accurate prediction of the outcome.<br />
One week before the election, I shared my forecast with friends‚Äîand when it turned out to be nearly spot-on, they jokingly called it an ‚ÄúAI-level prediction.‚Äù This post, with help from ChatGPT, outlines the logic behind my estimate and compares it with the actual results. I also argue this model may remain useful for future elections.</p>

<h2>üîç Why the 2024 General Election Was a ‚ÄúPrequel‚Äù to the Presidential Race</h2>

<p>| Metric               | Predicted                  | Actual (2025)                                                                 |

| <strong>Registered Voters</strong> | 44,391,871                  | 44,391,871 [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_South_Korean_presidential_election">source</a>] |
| <strong>Turnout Rate</strong>      | 75‚Äì78%                      | 79.38%                                                                        |
| <strong>Votes for Lee Jae-myung</strong> | ~17,200,000           | 17,287,513                                                                    |
| <strong>Vote Share (Lee)</strong>  | 50‚Äì55%                      | 49.42%                                                                        |</p>

<p>‚û°Ô∏è <strong>Prediction of raw vote count was nearly exact; vote share decreased as turnout increased.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>üéØ Prediction Formula</h2>

<p>Lee Jae-myung's vote count was nearly a fixed value‚Äîaround 17.2 million. The actual vote <em>share</em> was dependent on final turnout:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High turnout = lower percentage share</strong>, as opposition support mobilized.</li>
<li><strong>Low turnout = higher percentage share</strong>, as Lee‚Äôs core supporters were already solidified.</li>
</ul>

<p>| Scenario | Total Votes Cast | Lee's Vote Share |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| 75% Turnout | 33,293,903     | 51.6%            |
| 78% Turnout | 34,825,659     | 49.4%            |
| <strong>Actual</strong>   | 35,251,512     | 49.42%           |</p>

<p>üìå <strong>Takeaway</strong>:<br />
- The vote count is predictable based on previous general election results.
- The vote <em>percentage</em> varies depending on turnout, reflecting swing voters and marginal opposition mobilization.</p>

<hr />

<h2>üìà Why This Matters for Future Elections</h2>

<p>Since the 2000s, Korea‚Äôs elections follow a turnout pattern:
- Local elections &lt; General elections &lt; Presidential elections</p>

<p>Thus, <strong>the previous general election</strong> (not local or mayoral elections) offers the most reliable basis for forecasting a presidential race. Major scandals or national crises (like impeachment or martial law) should be layered as variables on top of this baseline.</p>

<h2>üóÇÔ∏è Turnout History: 2002‚Äì2025</h2>

<p>| Year | Election Type | Voter Population | Turnout |
|------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| 2002 | Presidential   | ~34.99M          | 70.8%   |
| 2007 | Presidential   | ~37.30M          | 63.0%   |
| 2012 | Presidential   | ~40.51M          | 75.8%   |

<h2>‚úçÔ∏è Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This simple prediction model proved highly effective.<br />
By using the general election's vote count as a base and adjusting for turnout, one can reasonably estimate future presidential results‚Äîbarring major national events.<br />
