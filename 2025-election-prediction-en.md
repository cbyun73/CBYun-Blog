# 🗳️ 2025 Korean Election: Lee Jae‑myung Vote Prediction Based on 2024 Turnout
📌 **A simple 1‑week‑prior forecast based on district vote share from the 2024 General Election**

## ✅ Introduction

On June 3, 2025, South Korea held an unprecedented presidential election following the impeachment of the former president under martial law.  
Despite political turbulence and rapidly shifting polls, I found that a remarkably simple formula allowed for a surprisingly accurate prediction of the outcome.  
One week before the election, I shared my forecast with friends—and when it turned out to be nearly spot-on, they jokingly called it an “AI-level prediction.”  
This post, with help from ChatGPT, outlines the logic behind my estimate and compares it with the actual results.  
I also argue this model may remain useful for future elections.

## 🔍 Why the 2024 General Election Was a “Prequel” to the Presidential Race

| Metric                    | Predicted         | Actual (2025)                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Registered Voters**     | 44,391,871        | 44,391,871 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_South_Korean_presidential_election)) |
| **Turnout Rate**          | 75–78%            | 79.38%                                                                        |
| **Votes for Lee Jae-myung** | ~17,200,000     | 17,287,513                                                                    |
| **Vote Share (Lee)**      | 49.7–51.6%        | 49.42%                                                                        |

➡️ **Prediction of raw vote count was nearly exact; vote share decreased as turnout increased.**

## 🎯 Prediction Formula

Lee Jae-myung's vote count was nearly fixed—around 17.2 million—based on:

- 2024 General Election Vote Share (50.56%)
- 2022 Presidential Election Turnout (77.1%)
- 2025 Registered Voters (44.39M)

**Expected total votes** = 44.39M × 77.1% ≈ 34.2M → 50.56% of that is ~17.2M votes.

The variable was not his supporters—but how many turned out for other candidates.  
Here’s how the share changes based on total turnout:

| Scenario        | Total Votes Cast | Lee's Vote Share |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 75% Turnout    | 33,293,903        | 51.6%            |
| 78% Turnout    | 34,825,659        | 49.7%            |
| **Actual**     | 35,251,512        | 49.42%           |

### 🔍 Key Takeaways

- Lee’s raw vote count was predictable (within 1% error)  
- His vote *share* decreased as total turnout increased

## 📈 Why This Matters for Future Elections

Korean elections show a consistent trend:  
**Local < General < Presidential** in terms of voter turnout.

Thus, the previous **General Election** offers the most solid predictor base for forecasting the next Presidential election—unless disrupted by major scandals or crises.
