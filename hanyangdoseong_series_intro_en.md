# [Journey Through Hanyangdoseong with AI] The Beginning of a Historical Time Travel

One of the most memorable books I read in university was *My Cultural Heritage Tour* by Professor Yoo Hong-joon. That book first taught me the joy of walking through historical places. Since then, I've long dreamed of documenting history in my own way someday.

## 🔍 Why I Started This Series

Recently, I watched Professor Yoo introduce hidden historical sites on the program *Knowledge Inside*. This reignited my passion. But I also know that without proper preparation, such a journey would merely be a stroll. So this time, I decided to do it right—with the help of AI.

## 🤖 Why AI?

From research to writing and visual planning, the workload is massive. That’s why I chose ChatGPT as my guide. With its ability to collect data and visualize it, I'm aiming for a richer, more immersive experience. Here's how AI has already helped:

- **Era**: Late Joseon Dynasty (circa King Jeongjo ~ King Cheoljong)
- **Character**: Commander of the royal guard (Geumwiyoung) investigating infiltration rumors
- **Mission**: Patrol the Hanyangdoseong defense perimeter
- **Narrative**: A blend of real photography, AI visualization, historical facts, and fictional storytelling

## 💡 Project Summary

A hybrid journey that combines modern photography with fictional storytelling—through the eyes of a royal commander patrolling the city walls in late Joseon.

### Core Format at Each Location:

1. 📷 Real-world photos from the walk
2. 🖼️ AI reinterpreted Joseon-style images
3. 🗺️ Historical background of each site
4. 🎙️ Dialogues between the patrol unit and AI  
   e.g.,  
   **Commander**: “Are those stone piles for hiding bodies or prayer rituals?”  
   **AI**: “Locals stacked them to pray for the safe return of soldiers…”

## 📌 Coming Up: Episode 1 — Changuimun

In the first post of the series, we’ll start our journey at **Changuimun**, a lesser-known but critical northern gate of Hanyang’s city wall. The patrol begins with a mission:

> “In the autumn of the year Eulhae, intelligence reports suggest the enemy may attempt entry through the Changuimun sector...”

The story will unfold from there.
